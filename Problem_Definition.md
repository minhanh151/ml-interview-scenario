# AI-Driven Loan Default Risk Reduction for a Acme Loans

## Background

As an ML Officer at a Acme Loans, the task is to develop an AI-driven solution to reduce loan defaults. The goal is to use advanced machine learning techniques to accurately predict the likelihood of loan defaults, aiding in informed lending decisions.

## Objective

Build a robust ML model predicting loan default likelihood, incorporating various data sources to improve loan approval processes and reduce default rates.

### Database:

#### Data Sources:

1. **Loan Application Data:** Applicant's personal information, loan amount requested, purpose of the loan.
2. **Financial History:** Credit score, existing debts, payment history, income details.
3. **Banking Information:** Account balances, transaction history, overdraft frequency (from open banking APIs).
4. **Behavioral Data:** Shopping habits, bill payment regularity (if accessible and compliant with privacy laws).
5. **Economic Indicators:** Employment rate, economic trends influencing an individual's financial stability.

## Conceptual and Analytical Problem Solving

### Features Development for Risk Assessment

Identify features to assess the risk profile of consumers, considering various data sources.

### Model Selection for V1

Decide on the best-fit model for initial deployment. Share the decision-making process.

### Analysis Post V1 Deployment (75% Accuracy)

Identify areas of improvement through detailed analyses.

### Identifying Model Biases

Determine and identify biases against certain individuals.

### Next Version of the Model (90% Accuracy)

Considerations and actions before deploying the model.

### Deployment Strategy

How to integrate the model into the existing workflow.

### Monitoring Mechanisms

Establish monitoring for model performance and data drift.

### Next Steps

Setting up additional protocols and processes for continuous improvement.

## Deliverables (Due in 7 Days)

- A predictive model identifying high-risk loan applicants.
- A deployment strategy with monitoring and updating protocols.

## Tasks

### Data Integration and Privacy Compliance

Ensure compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and integrate disparate data sources into a unified dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing

Conduct EDA to understand data distributions, correlations, and patterns. Clean and preprocess data, addressing missing values, outliers, and feature encoding.

### Feature Engineering

Develop features capturing customer risk profiles. Utilize domain knowledge for predictive feature construction.

### Model Development and Selection

Experiment with various ML models and perform hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

### Model Evaluation

Use metrics like AUC-ROC, accuracy, F1-score, and precision-recall. Focus on minimizing false negatives impacting financial decisions.

### Bias and Fairness Assessment

Evaluate and mitigate biases to ensure fair lending practices.

### Deployment and Monitoring

Develop a deployment strategy and establish monitoring for performance and data drift.

### Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement

Set up a system for insights from loan officers and customers. Regularly update the model with new data.

## Deliverables

- A comprehensive report detailing the approach, architecture decisions, development process, model insights, and fairness assessment.
- A predictive model for identifying high-risk loan applicants.
- A deployment strategy with monitoring and updating protocols.
